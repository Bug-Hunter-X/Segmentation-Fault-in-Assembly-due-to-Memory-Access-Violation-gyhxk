This repository demonstrates a common assembly language error: a segmentation fault caused by an out-of-bounds memory access.  The `bug.asm` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.asm` file provides a corrected version with improved bounds checking. This example highlights the importance of careful memory address calculation and error handling in low-level programming.
